    <h1>Tigers</h1>
    <p>
      The <em>tiger</em> is awesome because it is the <strong>king</strong> of
      the jungle. Unlike most members of the cat family, Tigers like water. They
      are good swimmers and often cool off in pools or streams. - Tigers can
      tell the age, gender, and reproductive condition of other Tigers by
      smelling their urine. - If you look a Tiger in the eyes it is less likely
      to kill you.
